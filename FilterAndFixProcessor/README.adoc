==  Introduction

This project is a processor that filters out success and start messages from Spring Cloud Task.
However, if it receives a task execution with an exit code of 2 it will cleanse the task_status table and send a task launch request to a rabbit exchange.

=== To build the demo project

```
./mvnw clean package
```

== DDL to create a stream via Spring Cloud Data Flow
```
:task-events > FilterAndFix --spring.datasource.url=<your DB> --spring.datasource.username=<your user> --spring.datasource.password=<your password> --spring.datasource.driverClassName=<your db driver> | tasklauncher
```
